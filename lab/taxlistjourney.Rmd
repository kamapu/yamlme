After a long review process, where a lot of improvements have been implemented,
the package [`taxlist`](https://docs.ropensci.org/taxlist/) managed to be
accepted in [**rOpenSci**](https://ropensci.org/).
The package `taxllist` handles taxonomic lists as **S4** objects in
[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/).
Such objects can be used as modules within data sets of biodiversity records as
in the package [`vegtable`](https://github.com/kamapu/vegtable).

In a brief talk a summary of the experiences during the process of submission to
**rOpenSci** was presented in the context of the conference [**LatinR
2020**](https://latin-r.com/en).
